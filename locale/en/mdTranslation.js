For example, an "item number" field that does not allow duplicates is ideal for indexing; conversely, a "gender" field that is used to record male and female is not suitable for indexing.',"如果一些字段总是需要一起参与检索，它们组合起来之后的重复率更低，例如「First Name」和「Last Name」，那么你可以同时选择这两个字段创建一个复合索引，比为这两个字段分别创建索引效果更好。":'If some fields always need to participate in the search together and they have a lower duplication rate when combined, such as "First Name" and "Last Name", then you can select both fields to create a compound index, which is better than creating separate indexes for these two fields.',"索引字段排序有什么用？":"What is the use of index field sorting?","索引字段的排序和你在视图中使用此字段参与排序的规则有关。当索引只有一个字段时，视图中排序的方向不会影响检索的加速；除此之外，请尽量保证在视图中的字段排序方式与索引中设置的一致，否则检索可能不会被加速。":"The sorting of an index field is related to the rules you use in the view to involve this field in the sorting. When the index has only one field, the direction of sorting in the view will not affect the acceleration of the retrieval; otherwise, please try to ensure that the field sorting in the view is the same as the one set in the index, otherwise the retrieval may not be accelerated.","为什么索引会创建失败？":"Why does index creation fail?","创建索引时，会有下列限制，不遵循限制可能会出现索引创建失败的情况：":"When creating an index, the following restrictions apply, and failure to follow them may result in index creation failure.","○ 创建「唯一索引」时，选择的索引字段在已有记录里不能存在重复值；":'o When creating a "unique index", the selected index field cannot have duplicate values in existing records.',"○ 创建索引时选择的字段不能和之前已创建的某个索引的字段完全一样；":"o the fields selected when creating an index cannot be exactly the same as the fields of a previously created index.","○ 一张工作表只能创建一个「文本索引」或「所有文本字段全文索引」；":'o Only one "text index" or "full text index of all text fields" can be created for a worksheet.',"○ 一个索引只能包含一个「选项」类型的字段，如单选/多选/人员/部门等；":'o An index can only contain one "option" type field, such as single/multiple select/person/department, etc.',"索引越多越好吗？":"Is more indexing better?","并非如此。索引只会加速检索，而在新增、更新、删除记录时系统会花费更多的时间用于更新索引，过多的索引会很明显的降低这些操作的速度，甚至影响到查询的速度。":"Not so. Indexing will only speed up retrieval, and the system will spend more time on updating indexes when adding, updating, and deleting records.
